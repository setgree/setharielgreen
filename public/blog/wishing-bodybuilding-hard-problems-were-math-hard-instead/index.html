<p>Alex Crompton introduces a <a href="https://www.alexcrompton.com/blog/2017/05/26/hard-is-not-defensible">useful distinction</a> between a ‘math hard’ problem, where the solution is hard to come up with but easy to copy, and a ‘bodybuilding hard’ problem, where the solution is easy to come up with and hard to copy.</p>
<p>I’d also say that the fundamental challenge of a math hard problem is that you don’t know in advance if there is a correct solution at all, or the right way to make progress on finding it. You might need to invent entirely new tools along the way. By contrast, it’s very unlikely you’ll invent something new in the weight room. Bodybuilding problems are often boring, repetitive, and painful,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> but at least we basically know how to make progress today and tomorrow and the next day.</p>
<p>On the margin, relative to other smart people I know, I seem to prefer bodybuilding problems to math hard ones. I never wanted to devise new statistical methods for my papers, or, frankly, ever worry that hard Ending factory farming, for instance, is probably bodybuilding hard because the problem is so huge. So I am often nonplussed when I see, e.g., folks on the EA forum debating in granular detail the relative QALYs of different farm animals. For me, at least, it suffices that their lived conditions are very bad, and now we need to go out and do the work of persuading people to change their behaviors; <a href="https://www.directactioneverywhere.com/">rescuing the animals</a> we can; or <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2022/07/a-brief-for-the-pigs-the-case-of-national-pork-producers-council-v-ross/">passing ballots</a> to improve their living conditions.</p>
