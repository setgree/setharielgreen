<p>I recently wrote a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zyQGt7hMgV3iKj8vKlPMgS1ese2L3-ACGZixJAT0re0/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.778fyscdi0hf">date me doc</a> â€“ see <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/02/style/date-me-docs.html">here</a> for context. (I continue to be <a href="https://setharielgreen.com/blog/i-ve-been-zeitgeisty-lately/">belatedly zeitgeisty</a>.)</p>
<p>To me, the case that single people should do this is self-evident: why not? what are the costs? But a few pieces of social context made writing one seem not just desirable but advisable:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Dating apps do not have our best interests in mind. They <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2010/11/25/generation-why/?srsltid=AfmBOorbb1cblet88L1FKWm2wTV7h9ucUhXDrW1y06a-rrDeK_j4a7Op">constrain our self-presentations</a> to the prompts some PM figured would best <a href="capture%20and%20monetize%20attention.">capture and monetize our attention</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Finding a partner is important the way finding a job is important. It would be imprudent to rely entirely on LinkedIn in the job search. People typically prepare a CV, share it multiple places, take unsolicited emails form recruiters, etc. Surely we should be multimodal in our dating searches as well?</p></li>
<li><p>Many single people I know wish to be set up by friends. But what would a friend say about me? I have no idea, and probably neither do they. Reducing me to a set of attributes, fixing it in oneâ€™s mind, and repeating it is work. A date me doc is a way of helping our friends do that work.</p></li>
<li><p>What is your comparative advantage on the dating market? If it is beauty, then Tinder might be a good fit. Mine sure isnâ€™t ðŸ˜ƒ</p></li>
<li><p>Do you remember a time when trust was assumed? At beloved Swarthmore, I could strike up a conversation with just about anyone and assume they were an earnest, quirky nerd, and they could say the same of me. A format that allows that to shine through â€” or allows for people to inadvertently reveal that they are not who they think they are â€” helps establish that baseline trust again.</p></li>
</ol>
