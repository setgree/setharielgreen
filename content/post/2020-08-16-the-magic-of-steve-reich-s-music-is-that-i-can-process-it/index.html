<p>I would like to be able to hear and reproduce every note of the introduction to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0QW4RCyj2Tc2N0hD1FjkcS?si=imNv5LlsQuq2-F7ULjsxTA">Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</a>, but it is too dense. For other, simpler parts of the soundtrack, you can find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdVl5Yc4_mo">Youtube videos</a> that display all pitches, their duration, and their position on a keyboard. I could more or less transcribe the same portions of the score onto a musical staff by ear, but I can’t do this for the introduction, because simultaneous notes in a timbre (electronic organ) I have little experience with are really hard to tease apart. I’ve been listening to it on repeat, hoping eventually it will sink in, but it might not.</p>
<p>Contrast this with Steve Reich’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0yTZmMgI5I">Four Organs</a>. I think that if I sat down at an organ and tried a few different configurations, I could figure out the opening chord exactly (or I could look at the score). But more importantly, each new note, each new <em>idea</em> is introduced one at a time, and I can process it: There’s an F# to an E, there’s a G# to an A.</p>
<p>Life is not like this. Input comes in too fast and I’m overwhelmed, another day too slow and I’m bored. Reich’s music cuts right down the middle. It is soothing, a finely crafted engine. It enjoins the listener to keep moving.</p>
<p>If I’m ever asked what I like about minimalism, this is what I’d say.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, the introduction to Nausicaä provides different pleasures. It’s a rainy Sunday in the suburbs in a pandemic; I may listen to it 100 times today and still fail to parse the mystery, overmatched, beyond ken.</p>
