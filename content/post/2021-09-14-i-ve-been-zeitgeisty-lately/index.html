<p>Most things I do don’t get featured in trends sections. I wonder if the trend of being trendy will continue? I also am prompted to think about much the ideas that feel original or counternormative to me are just generally ‘in the air.’</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>This one I will explain. I got the J&amp;J shot in April 2021. When I got back to NY in August from traveling, I was worried about breakout cases. The fact that I got one dose in the first place rather than two seems to have been an artifact of clinical trial decisions rather than the result of a cognizable scientific principle, and we have strong theoretical reasons to believe that boosters provide additional immunogenic benefits; contra one of the dumbest things <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/02/03/world/covid-19-coronavirus#astrazeneca-coronavirus-vaccine">I’ve yet read in a newspaper</a>, I think we can indeed make generalizations between vaccines. So I got a second. I had no compunction about lying to do so. I also didn’t think it was morally relevant that other people who are more deserving of a dose haven’t gotten theirs yet, because the shot I took, on the margin, probably equals one fewer dose being thrown out.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
