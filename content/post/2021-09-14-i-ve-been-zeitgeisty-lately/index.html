<p>I wonder if the trend of being trendy will continue? I also am prompted to think about much the ideas that feel original or appealingly counternormative to me are just ‘in the air.’</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>This one I will explain. I got the J&amp;J shot in April 2021. When I got back to NY in August from traveling, I was worried about breakout cases. The fact that I got one dose in the first place rather than two seems to have been an artifact of clinical trial design considerations, and a desire to go to market faster, rather than something cognizably scientific; we often see that boosters provide immunogenic response; and, contra one of the dumbest things <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/02/03/world/covid-19-coronavirus#astrazeneca-coronavirus-vaccine">I’ve read in a newspaper</a>, I think we can indeed make generalizations between vaccines. So I got a second; I felt no compunction about lying when they asked me if I had been vaccinated already. I also can’t see a way in which my declining a shot would have led to some more deserving person getting hers faster. (It’s a lot more likely, I think, that the marginal dose would just go in the trash.)<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
