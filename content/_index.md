Hi I'm Seth! <img align="right" src="/./_index_files/homepage-photos/YHITW-face.JPG" alt="Blairsville, GA, 2021" width="35%" height="35%"/> I am a writer and researcher currently finishing a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail. In May, I'll be starting a position with [Global Income Coin](https://www.globalincomecoin.com/).

Previously I was a Data Analyst at [Riskified](https://www.riskified.com/), Developer Advocate at [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/), and an [academic researcher](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=66CRLeoAAAAJ&hl=en).

Here, you can find my [blog](/blog), a [selection of my writing](/projects), my [CV](/files/cv.pdf), and links to my [social media](/other-selves).
