Hi I'm Seth! <img align="right" src="/./_index_files/homepage-photos/YHITW-face.JPG" alt="Blairsville, GA, 2021" width="35%" height="35%"/> I am a freelance writer currently based in New Orleans.

Previously I was a Data Analyst at [Riskified](https://www.riskified.com/), Developer Advocate at [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/), and an [academic researcher](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=66CRLeoAAAAJ&hl=en).

Here, you can find my [blog](/blog), [CV](/files/cv.pdf), a [selection of my writing](/projects), and links to my [social media](/other-selves).

I'm about 80% done with a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail.
