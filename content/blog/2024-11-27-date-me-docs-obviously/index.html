<p>I recently wrote a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zyQGt7hMgV3iKj8vKlPMgS1ese2L3-ACGZixJAT0re0/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.778fyscdi0hf">date me doc</a> – see <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/02/style/date-me-docs.html">here</a> for context. (I continue to be <a href="https://setharielgreen.com/blog/i-ve-been-zeitgeisty-lately/">belatedly zeitgeisty</a>.)</p>
<p>To me, the case that single people should do this is self-evident: why not? what are the costs? But a few pieces of social context made writing one seem not just desirable but advisable:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>To dating apps — increasingly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240328154343/https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/match-group-can-get-away-acquiring-25-dating-sites-counting-151306438.html">owned and run by one megacorp</a> — we are the <a href="https://sauconpanther.org/2535/arts-and-entertainment/if-youre-not-paying-for-the-product-then-you-are-the-product/">product, not the client</a>. They <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2010/11/25/generation-why/?srsltid=AfmBOorbb1cblet88L1FKWm2wTV7h9ucUhXDrW1y06a-rrDeK_j4a7Op">dampen and constrain our self-presentations</a> to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57933306-stolen-focus">capture and monetize attention</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Finding a partner is at least as important as finding a job. It would be imprudent to rely entirely on LinkedIn in the job search. Surely we should be platform-agnostic in our dating search as well?</p></li>
<li><p>Many single people I know wish to be set up by friends. But what would a friend say about me? I have no idea, and probably neither do they. Reducing me to a set of attributes, fixing it in one’s mind, and repeating it is work. A date me doc is a way of helping our friends do that work.</p></li>
<li><p>The flow/thrive times of my life had a high level of assumed trust. At beloved Swarthmore, I could strike up a conversation with just about anyone and assume they were an earnest, quirky nerd, and they could say the same of me. A format that allows that to shine through — or allows for people to (inadvertently) <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1882010">reveal their type</a> — helps establish that baseline trust again.</p></li>
</ol>
