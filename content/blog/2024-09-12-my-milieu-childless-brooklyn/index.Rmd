I have noticed recently that I seem to be part of a distinct demographic group without a name. We are:

* Ages 30-45 
* Living in Brooklyn
* thoroughly [professional managerial class](https://thebellows.org/the-double-horseshoe-theory-of-class-politics-the-bellows-2/) 
* posessed of [omnivorous tastes](https://c-j-l-c.org/portfolio/omnivores-and-inequality-2/)
* Very physically active (running, climbing, and hiking mostly)
* joiners of [clubs](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/24/style/new-york-city-running-clubs.html) and [leagues](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/15/nyregion/ny-games.html)
* childless (maybe kids are on the long-term agenda, maybe not)
* reasonably successful at work but not workaholics
* pretty good at our hobbies but not elite
* without a singular dominant interest in our lives
* occasionally experiencing the lifestyles of much richer people (e.g. when we take all-expenses paid trips to Singapore or Istanbul for work)

There's a parallel to David Brooks's [Bobos in Paradise](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/b/brooks-bobos.html) -- "These are highly educated folk who have one foot in the bohemian world of creativity and another foot in the bourgeois realm of ambition and worldly success. The members of the new information age elite are bourgeois bohemians" --but I also want to capture our dedication to stakeless leagues and games as a kind of rebuke to our status-competitive, overscheduled childhoods.  

What should we call ourselves?
