<p>My favorite moment in <em>M3gan</em>, comes when Allison Williams says to the title character: “I know you think you’re maximizing your <a href="http://kronosapiens.github.io/blog/2017/03/28/objective-functions-in-machine-learning.html">objective function</a>.” it was fun to hear an explicit nod to the language of AI-alignment; someone who worked on this movie reads LessWrong, or talked to people who do.</p>
<p><em>M3gan</em> could serve as a great prequel to an AI apocalypse movie (though I think it’s unlikely). But thinking those movies over – <em>Terminator</em>, <em>Oblivion</em>, <em>The Matrix</em> – they’re mostly action movies that come down to a test of strength. The robots basically think and act like humans, albeit more indestructible.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Generalized Pretrained Models are more and more a part of our lives, and what sticks out to me about them is their <em>weirdness</em>. Kevin Roose’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/17/opinion/letters/bing-chatbot-kevin-roose.html">chat with Sydney</a> makes her seem vaguely dangerous but mostly just unhinged. <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/03/two-moves-alphago-lee-sedol-redefined-future/">AlphaGo’s Move 37 in a championship Go game</a> was weird enough to induce a 15 minute break in the game. An ugly t-shirt can utterly confound <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/facial-recognition-t-shirt-block">facial recognition software and render its wearer invisible</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s forecast these developments 10, 20, 50 years in the future. Imagine that AI has gotten a lot smarter and more dangerous, but basically followed an evolutionary path from today’s machine learning algorithms.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Imagine further that it <em>inherited the quirks of its ancestors</em>, the way we retain our appendixes and our proclivity to identify every startling noise as a tiger in the brush. How would you outwit such an adversary? What sorts of maneuvers would you pursue? And what clever, weird things would work against a computer but not against a human, the way <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/175e5314-a7f7-4741-a786-273219f433a1">Kellin Pelrine distracted AlphaGo</a>?</p>
<p>A malevolent, omni-rational AI with access to nanotech would be an insurmountable opponent. But a bounded thing with evolutionary heritage, we could deceive, negotiate with, or fight. I’d love to see someone up-to-date on ML research take a crack at writing or visualizing what this might look like.</p>
