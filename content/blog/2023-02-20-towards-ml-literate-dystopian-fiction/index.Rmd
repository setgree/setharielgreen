My favorite moment in _M3gan_, comes when Allison Williams says to the title character: "I know you think youâ€™re maximizing your [objective function](http://kronosapiens.github.io/blog/2017/03/28/objective-functions-in-machine-learning.html)." it was fun to hear an explicit nod to the language of AI-alignment; someone who worked on this movie reads LessWrong, or talked to people who do. 

_M3gan_ could serve as a great prequel to an AI apocalypse movie (though I think it's unlikely). But thinking those movies over -- _Terminator_, _Oblivion_, _The Matrix_ -- they're mostly action movies that come down to a test of strength. The robots basically think and act like humans, albeit more indestructible.

Meanwhile, Generalized Pretrained Models are more and more a part of our lives, and what sticks out to me about them is their _weirdness_. Kevin Roose's [chat with Sydney](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/17/opinion/letters/bing-chatbot-kevin-roose.html) makes her seem vaguely dangerous but mostly just unhinged. [AlphaGo's Move 37 in a championship Go game](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/two-moves-alphago-lee-sedol-redefined-future/) was weird enough to induce a 15 minute break in the game. An ugly t-shirt can utterly confound [facial recognition software and render its wearer invisible](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/facial-recognition-t-shirt-block). 

Let's forecast these developments 10, 20, 50 years in the future. Imagine that AI has gotten a lot smarter and more dangerous, but basically followed an evolutionary path from today's machine learning algorithms.^[Some experts dispute that this is [likely or even possible](https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1621805604900585472).] Imagine further that it _inherited the quirks of its ancestors_, the way we retain our appendixes and our proclivity to identify every startling noise as a tiger in the brush. How would you outwit such an adversary? What sorts of maneuvers would you pursue? And what clever, weird things would work against a computer but not against a human, the way [Kellin Pelrine distracted AlphaGo](https://www.ft.com/content/175e5314-a7f7-4741-a786-273219f433a1)?

A malevolent, omni-rational AI with access to nanotech would be an insurmountable opponent. But a bounded thing with evolutionary heritage, we could deceive, negotiate with, or fight. I'd love to see someone up-to-date on ML research take a crack at writing or visualizing what this might look like.
