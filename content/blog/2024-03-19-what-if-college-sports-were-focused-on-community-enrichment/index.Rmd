In college I played chamber music and ran track and cross country (XC). While both were subsidized by the school, playing music has positive spillovers both for the community (people got to see our concerts) and into the future (e.g something about how a meaningful life involves making art). Track & XC had, to a first approximation, zero positive benefits for the community at large. (Track meets are boring and XC meets are boring _and_ far away.) Any justification of the sport as a college-sanctioned activity for some but not all people has to start with enrichment for participants.

It's plausible that [team sports build valuable skills](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-10-14/sports-are-part-of-the-college-curriculum-too) that translate to higher salaries and bigger donations to colleges. Personally I find that hard to believe for track & XC (most of my teammates work extremely-typical-for-Swarthmore-graduates jobs). But I also notice that most of my teammates don't run anymore. Lives happen and interests shift, I get it. But I also think that a lot of it has to do with how college athletics turn games of pleasure into contests for status. People on my team took running very seriously, and took their roles as student athletes very seriously. Maybe that makes sense at some places where the teams are really good, but this was Swarthmore: no one cared how we ran. _I_ barely cared. But for people who took it seriously, it was a lot of stress, and I attribute a lot of the [overuse injuries](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/dlieberman/files/2012c.pdf) I saw to that social and personal pressure. It also facilitates burnout. Ten years later, by and large, college athletes give it up. And that's a shame, because running is a really fun way to get out of the house and meet people.

Observation: The running clubs I'm a part of have become, post-pandemic, Instagramified. If I go on five structured runs a week, four begin with a group photo destined for social media. (The one I went to this morning didn't, but I noticed someone dutifully snapping pictures as we began to run up and down a hill). I've been running ~4-6 days a week for almost 20 years now, so I find this mystifying. There is nothing special to me about going for a run, nothing worth commemoration any more than brushing my teeth. But it's not like that for everyone! A lot of people are just getting into it and they like the social aspects and the performance aspect and the "I showed up!" aspect. As a running friend recently put it, "think of it as a public health strategy. Anything that gets people moving is good." 

Extending this logic back to college athletics: how would things be different if their whole point was public health, e.g. fitness, community, time in the sun? They'd be open to everybody. Maybe games/competitions/meets would have ability qualifiers but group practices and workouts would be come-one, come-all. They'd put on exhibition matches/fun runs regularly. They'd raise money for charities. They'd put on trips. Coaches could be part-time or volunteers. Colleges could do away with recruiting and cut down the athletic staff to the bare minimum necessary (probably just enough to resolve conflicts over, e.g. field time). Participants could pay their own way if they wanted to go to away games or fundraise.

In other words, they would just become athletic clubs. 

Overall I think this would be a better model for college athletics than the one we have.
