<p>Bryan Caplan asks us to think about <a href="https://reason.com/2024/05/07/rent-free-qa-bryan-caplan-on-build-baby-build/">ending zoning</a>, while <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01944363.2019.1651216">Manville, Monkkonen &amp; Lens (2019)</a> advocate for ending single-family zoning. I share these priorities, but I think they sound disruptive. Here are five propositions about housing and construction that, I hope, sound more agreeable.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If a single-family home is ok, a <a href="https://missingmiddlehousing.com/types/duplex-side-by-side">duplex</a>, <a href="https://missingmiddlehousing.com/types/triplex">triplex</a>, <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2024/3/15/an-adu-called-by-any-other-name">in-law suite</a>, or <a href="https://missingmiddlehousing.com/types/cottage-court">cottage court</a> are all probably ok too.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Cities with a <a href="https://missingmiddlehousing.com/">wide variety of housing</a> are fun to walk around.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Neighborhoods like <a href="https://andreastrong.substack.com/p/so-long-williamsburg-carroll-gardens">Carroll Gardens</a> or <a href="https://www.planning.org/greatplaces/neighborhoods/2007/parkslope.htm">Park Slope</a>, with <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/12/mr-commentator-sure-on-yimby.html">short commutes and medium density</a>, are lovely.</p></li>
<li><p>It would be fantastic for public health if most Americans had <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2023/7/28/if-we-want-a-shift-to-walking-we-need-to-prioritize-dignity">compliant, safe, and dignified walking paths</a> to a <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2023/10/31/no-purchase-necessary">third place</a> and a shopping center.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Our most productive regions — the <a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/institute/research/cities-local-communities/institute-san-francisco-economy">San Francisco Bay</a>, <a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/dallas-fort-worth-leads-all-metro-areas-in-population-growth/3489168/">Dallas Fort-Worth</a>, and the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-28/mapping-the-mega-regions-powering-the-world-s-economy#:~:text=Bos%2DWash%2C,Kingdom%E2%80%99s%20or%20Brazil%E2%80%99s.">Northeast megalopolis</a> — can all become clean, safe, and easy to get around.</li>
