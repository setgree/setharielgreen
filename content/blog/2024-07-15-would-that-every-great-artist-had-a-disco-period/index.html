<p>I saw RJD2 spin a few weeks ago, and I was very pleased to hear him play The Who’s <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0LN5gIsS5tQSmRzQrHSaTR?si=a3a7a5cc79804a21">Eminence Front</a>, a great, dance-y track whose keyboards evoke (for me) Steve Reich’s <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1c2F2h6Af9skg91Wp5xl1Q?si=103c13efea914bd8">Four Organs</a> or the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0QW4RCyj2Tc2N0hD1FjkcS?si=69983ff2697e404a">opening theme to Nausicaä</a>. Among great rock artists pivoting to dance music, I’d put this track second in my personal pantheon, behind only Paul McCarthey’s <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4zcoGX2OQMMf4gs6KO9jzX?si=1a91fc17ab8c4272">Temporary Secretary</a>, which, as far as I know, sounds like nothing else ever recorded.</p>
<p>Also high on my list are <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3hJLKtTpgct9Y9wKww0BiR?si=78c9d3f29c684661">I Miss You</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6Qb7gtV6Q4MnUjSbkFcopl?si=a54a7cf7a750491d">50 Ways to Leave your Lover</a>. Hearing these songs “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/arts/okeeffes-hawaii-paintings.html?auth=login-google1tap&amp;login=google1tap">is kind of like finding out Brian Wilson had a desert period</a>.” It’s such a pleasure hearing geniuses venture into adjacent fields. Another one that comes to mind is the ending to Radiohead’s <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0gTRROuntlrPQ64W3J2Etv?si=8c996b49429d48f5">Electioneering</a>, where we learn that they could have been an outstanding heavy metal act.</p>
<p>At the <a href="https://www.noguchi.org/">Noguchi Museum</a>, the tour guide may tell you that when Noguchi felt that he had mastered something, he ventured into other forms. I admire that, though I probably won’t emulate it. I’m so far from mastery of anything that I can’t really imagine getting bored and moving further afield.</p>
<p>Every day we must hone the craft. But if you’re Paul McCartney, you might as well take the risk, for which I’m grateful.</p>
