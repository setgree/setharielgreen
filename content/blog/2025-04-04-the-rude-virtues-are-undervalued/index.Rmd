In 2023, a Harvard professor was [cancelled](https://www.thecollegefix.com/conservative-harvard-professor-describes-condemnation-for-views-on-marriage-abortion/) for having signed a brief for [Obergefell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges) stating that states can respect the "equal dignity of all persons" while also promoting "the distinct benefits of a male-female marriage scheme in law and culture," and for having written some things that [signal approval of abortion restrictions](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2799598).

From [his own account](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590113323000226), a few details stand out:

> At the Epidemiology departmental faculty meeting on April 5th, a central agenda item was “Discussion on matters related to [my] views.” The Department chair allowed me to make some remarks prior to this discussion. **I commented that I had real sorrow over the pain and distress in the community**...
>
> Throughout this time, **I agreed to every request from faculty, staff, or students to meet, either individually or in small groups, to talk through the various issues, or for them to share their pain**...
>
> During the week of April 10–14, six more 2-hour circle dialogue listening sessions were scheduled...The University's Vice-Provost wrote to me stating, “I know I speak for all in the University's administration when I write that **we respect you and your opinions**, and your rights to free expression.”...
>
> A week later, on April 21st, I was notified by the Dean that there was to be a cessation of scheduling additional circle dialogues, after the fourteen 2-hour sessions that had occurred; and that the University-wide statement on academic freedom, and University policies on using one's affiliation, had been distributed the Academic Council and Department chairs; the e-mail also expressed an expectation that in the new academic year **there would be additional teaching and learning modules on academic freedom**.

It is striking how both the professor and Harvard are so *polite* here: so very solicitous, even obsequious. Had I been in the professor's shoes, I would have been sorely tempted to say: "y'all, these are my beliefs, and if you don't like them, that's your problem. If you don't want to take my class, that's fine. But we'll be keeping your tuition." I would have been tempted to be *rude*: impolite, ill-mannered, disrespectful, and abrupt, come what may.

Rudeness has become very right-coded, [e.g.](https://x.com/CathyYoung63/status/1907918499575738577)

But a little rudeness — fearlessness, a love of battle, a disregard for norms that favor the status quo — would have gone a long way for [Columbia recently](https://setharielgreen.com/blog/columbia-is-scared-of-discovery/) (and probably [Harvard in the coming weeks](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/republicans-harvard-funding.html)). If you can't tell some public health students to STFU, how are you going to say it to Trump?

Ah, these troubled institutions. They're [so nice. They're not good, they're not bad, they're just nice](https://youtu.be/W0XC2M465yU?si=RfkzFJ0QeKSAgdp2&t=84).[^1] They want everyone to be heard, everyone to be included.

I, by contrast, am on team [pardon my freedom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrajuEyRLxs), the libertine wing of the liberal movement, and have been since I was a teenager.[^2] I think that pleasure is good, in its rudest forms as well. I believe that it is virtuous to put up with people who offend and annoy us.[^3] And I think that defending these principles sometimes means getting up in people's faces and telling them that their hurt feelings do not grant them a right to dictate our behavior.[^4]

[^3]: [Fran Lebowitz says](https://bolstablog.wordpress.com/2008/11/20/smoke/#more-1614): "I understand, of course, that many people find smoking objectionable. That is their right. I would, I assure you, be the very last to criticize the annoyed. I myself find many-- even most-- things objectionable. Being offended is the natural consequence of leaving one's home. I do not like aftershave lotion, adults who roller-skate, children who speak French, or anyone who is unduly tan. I do not, however, go around enacting legislation and putting up signs. In private I avoid such people; in public they have the run of the place. I stay at home as much as possible, and so should they. When it is necessary, however, to go out of the house, they must be prepared, as I am, to deal with the unpleasant personal habits of others. That is what "public" means."
