<p>Sixty-four in all! I had a sense of what some of these meant but included them if I wasn’t pretty sure, and a lot of the usages were archaic.</p>
<p>The joy of putting together a list like this was both learning a bunch of fun words and also engaging with the people who have tread before me in understanding LOTR minutiae, e.g., the folks who wrote the <a href="http://www.tolkienenglishglossary.com/Lord_of__The_Rings/Lord_of_the_Rings_T_-_Z/lord_of_the_rings_t_-_z.html">Tolkien Glossary</a> and <em><a href="https://www.oed.com/applib/newsitem/30/tolkien-and-the-oed">Tolkien and the OED</a></em>.</p>
