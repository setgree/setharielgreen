<p>she imparts to the text the full weight of her celebrity. The words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally taking flight<br />
I know you don’t think it’s right<br />
I know that you think it’s fake<br />
Maybe fake’s what I like</p>
</blockquote>
<p>become rich with the overtones of her many personas: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/badgalriri/?hl=en">badgirlriri</a>, the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/entertainment/rihanna-wealth-scli-intl/index.html">world’s richest woman musician</a>, the CEO of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenty_Beauty">huge corporation</a> – a person who has lived half her life under unbearable scrutiny, here, acknowledging the burden of making art that appeals to the median human. When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Parker_(musician)">Kevin Parker</a> sings the same words, he speaks to a smaller niche, defending himself against accusations of selling out for achieving a tiny fraction of the fame Rihanna lives with.</p>
<p>That the text bears the author’s intent, but also the state of the speaker – these two versions, these two songs, drive that home particularly well because (as far as I can tell) literally nothing besides the vocals is different between them.</p>
<p>Cf. Borges’s <em>Pierre Menard, Author of Don Quixote</em>, a story about a man who endeavors to write something</p>
<blockquote>
<p>subterranean, interminably heroic, and unequalled and which is also – oh, the possibilities inherent in the man! – inconclusive. This work, possibly the most significant of our time, consists of the ninth and thirty-eighth chapters of Part One of <em>Don Quixote</em> and a fragment of the twenty-second chapter…<br />
He did not want to compose another <em>Don Quixote</em> – which would be easy – but <em>the Don Quixote</em>. It is unnecessary to add that his aim was never to produce a mechanical transcription of the original; he did not propose to copy it. His admirable ambition was to produce pages which would coincide – word for word and line for line – with those of Miguel de Cervantes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I hear Rihanna’s “Same Ol’ Mistakes,” I hear just this: a song that coincides “word for word and line for line” with Tame Impala’s song of the same name, and means something entirely different.</p>
<p>Of particular interest, a passage in <em>Pierre Menard</em> comparing a line from the two <em>Don Quixote</em>s:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">The text of Cervantes and that of Menard are verbally identical, but the second is almost infinitely richer. (More ambiguous, his detractors will say; but that ambiguity is a richness.) It is a revelation to compare the <em>Don Quixote</em> of Menard with that of Cervantes. The latter, for instance, wrote (<em>Don Quixote</em>, Part One, Chapter Nine):</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">    […truth, whose mother is history, who is the rival of time, depository of deeds, witness of the past, example and lesson to the present, and warning to the future.]</div>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Written in the seventeenth century, written by the “ingenious layman” Cervantes, this enumeration is a mere rhetorical eulogy of history. Menard, on the other hand, writes:</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">    […truth, whose mother is history, who is the rival of time, depository of deeds, witness of the past, example and lesson to the present, and warning to the future.]</div>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">History, <em>mother</em> of truth; this idea is astounding. Menard, a contemporary of William James, does not define history as an investigation of reality, but as its origin…Equally vivid is the contrast in styles. The archaic style of Menard – in the last analysis, a foreigner – suffers from a certain affectation. Not so that of his precursor, who handles easily the ordinary Spanish of his time.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder what Rihanna would make of this?</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, Borges’s next sentence, I part ways with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no intellectual exercise which is not ultimately useless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t know, I had fun thinking about this. Is that not a kind of use?</p>
