<li><p>I would have enjoyed this movie a bit more with some tighter editing, less repetition, and more leavening humor. But I did enjoy it. <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2024/09/the-substance-demi-moore-movie-margaret-qualley.html">Diana Stevens</a> didn’t.</p></li>
<li><p>This movie is basically Fight Club with no good/bad distinction between the halves of the self. Sarah (Although Fight Club is also a little confused about this because it’s so horny for Brad Pitt.) <a href="https://thespool.net/reviews/movies/film-review-the-substance-2024-mubi-demi-moore-margaret-qualley/">Sarah Gorr</a> makes the same connection.</p></li>
<li><p>Body horror, as a genre, has a lot of built-in audience punishment. The strange thing about this movie was its quantity of titillating material. Is one meant to compensate for the other? Perhaps the movie is saying: “Here are 200 shots of Margaret Qualley’s ass. We dare you to stare. Now here’s a monster spraying blood on a studio audience. That’s what you get!” I found this juxtaposition a little hard to process. So did <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/rhonda-garelick">Rhonda Garelick</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I liked the the Elizabeth-making-food scene because it makes the connection between borrowing-the-flesh-of-another-to-stay-young and eating meat explicit. Blood sausage is literally vampiric. I have not seen this connection pointed out elsewhere yet.</p></li>
