1.  I would have enjoyed this movie a bit more with some tighter editing, less repetition, and more leavening humor. But I did enjoy it.

2.  This movie is basically Fight Club with no good/bad distinction between the halves of the self. (Although Fight Club is also a little confused about this because it's so horny for Brad Pitt.)

3.  Body horror, as a genre, has a lot of built-in audience punishment. The strange thing about this movie was its quantity of titillating material. Is one meant to compensate for the other? Perhaps the movie is saying: "Here are 200 shots of Margaret Qualley's ass. We dare you to stare. Now here's a monster spraying blood on a studio audience. That's what you get!" I found this a little hard to process.

4.  I liked the the Elizabeth-making-food scene because it makes the connection between borrowing-the-flesh-of-another-to-stay-young and eating meat explicit. Blood sausage is literally vampiric.
