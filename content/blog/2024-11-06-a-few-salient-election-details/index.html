<p>Of the <a href="http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail">many</a>, here are a few that stick out:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Harris got zero votes in 2020 because she has <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-12-04/skelton-california-senator-kamala-harris-drops-out-presidential-race">no natural constituency</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020.html">isn’t good</a> at campaigning. Why would things have been different this time?</p></li>
<li><p>Trump is what McCain wanted to be, a true maverick. Getting <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/tulsi-gabbards-transition-democrat-high-profile-role-trumps/story?id=113220531">Tulsi Gabbard</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c134p2k24nzo">RFK Jr.</a> onboard — dominating <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-crank-realignment-is-bad-for">the crank vote</a> without alienating mainstream Republicans — is remarkable.</p></li>
<li><p>Democrats have bungled governance, <a href="https://x.com/AaronGuhreen/status/1854000739653435613">over</a> and <a href="https://x.com/timurkuran/status/1854023445035503778">over</a>. Last year we learned that California has apparently always been capable of <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/gavin-newsom-slammed-cleaning-san-francisco-1843412">making San Francisco a nice place to walk around</a>, but only did so to impress President Xi. I am at least a <em>little</em> glad to see this way of doing things rebuked.</p></li>
<li><p>Trump is a <a href="https://x.com/FarnoushAmiri/status/1854111660920738066">dangerous</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/us/politics/trump-speeches-age-cognitive-decline.html">failing</a> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/23/trump-bleach-one-year-484399">moron</a>. It’s still <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2016/11/trump_has_no_business_being_ne.html">very bad</a> for him to have command of nuclear weapons. For me, this consideration dwarfs others because it puts everything at hazard.</p></li>
<li><p>Elon is the man of the moment. What he’s accomplished in the past 5-10 years, not to mention getting this one right and putting his money where his mouth is about it, beggars belief. It was <a href="https://x.com/nxthompson/status/1854008314478072129">insanely stupid</a> of Democrats to alienate him.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y7HsS4bj-4">We carry on</a>.</p></li>
</ol>
