Of the [many](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail), these stick out:

1. Harris got zero votes in 2020 because she has [no natural constituency](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-12-04/skelton-california-senator-kamala-harris-drops-out-presidential-race) and [isn't good](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020.html) at campaigning. Why would things have been different this time?

2. Trump is what McCain wanted to be, a true maverick. Getting [Tulsi Gabbard](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/tulsi-gabbards-transition-democrat-high-profile-role-trumps/story?id=113220531) and [RFK Jr.](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c134p2k24nzo) onboard --- dominating [the crank vote](https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-crank-realignment-is-bad-for) without alienating mainstream Republicans --- is remarkable.

3. Democrats have [bungled governance](https://www.joshbarro.com/p/trump-didnt-deserve-to-win-but-we), [over](https://x.com/AaronGuhreen/status/1854000739653435613) and [over](https://x.com/timurkuran/status/1854023445035503778). Last year we learned that California has apparently always been capable of [making San Francisco a nice place to walk around](https://www.newsweek.com/gavin-newsom-slammed-cleaning-san-francisco-1843412), but only did so to impress President Xi. I am at least a _little_ glad to see this way of doing things rebuked.

4. Trump is a [dangerous](https://x.com/FarnoushAmiri/status/1854111660920738066), [failing](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/us/politics/trump-speeches-age-cognitive-decline.html) [moron](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/23/trump-bleach-one-year-484399). It's still [very bad](https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2016/11/trump_has_no_business_being_ne.html) for him to have command of nuclear weapons. For me, this consideration dwarfs others because it puts everything at hazard.

5. [Alienating](https://x.com/nxthompson/status/1854008314478072129) [Elon](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/10/musk-on-sharks.html) [Musk](https://www.semafor.com/article/08/24/2023/doj-sues-spacex-for-not-hiring-asylum-seekers-and-refugees) was a bad call.

6. [We carry on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y7HsS4bj-4).
