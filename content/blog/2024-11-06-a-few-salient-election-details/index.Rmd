Of the [many](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail), here are a few that stick out:

1. Harris got zero votes in 2020 because she has [no natural constituency](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-12-04/skelton-california-senator-kamala-harris-drops-out-presidential-race) and [isn't good](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020.html) at campaigning. Why would things have been different this time?

2. Trump is what McCain wanted to be, a true maverick. Getting [Tulsi Gabbard](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/tulsi-gabbards-transition-democrat-high-profile-role-trumps/story?id=113220531) and [RFK Jr.](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c134p2k24nzo) onboard --- dominating [the crank vote](https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-crank-realignment-is-bad-for) without alienating mainstream Republicans --- is remarkable.

3. Democrats have bungled governance, [over](https://x.com/AaronGuhreen/status/1854000739653435613) and [over](https://x.com/timurkuran/status/1854023445035503778). Last year we learned that Gavin Newsom has apparently always been capable of [making San Francisco a nice place to walk around](https://www.newsweek.com/gavin-newsom-slammed-cleaning-san-francisco-1843412), but only did so ti impress President Xi. I am at least a _little_ glad to see this way of doing things rebuked.

4. Trump is a [dangerous](https://x.com/FarnoushAmiri/status/1854111660920738066), [failing](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/us/politics/trump-speeches-age-cognitive-decline.html) [moron](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/23/trump-bleach-one-year-484399). It's still [very bad](https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2016/11/trump_has_no_business_being_ne.html) for him to have command of nuclear weapons. For me, this consideration dwarfs others because it puts everything at hazard.

5. Elon is the man of the moment. What he's accomplished in the past 5-10 years, not to mention getting this one right and putting his money where his mouth is about it, beggars belief. It was [insanely stupid](https://x.com/nxthompson/status/1854008314478072129) of Democrats to alienate him.
