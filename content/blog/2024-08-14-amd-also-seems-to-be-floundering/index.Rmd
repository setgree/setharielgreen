Intel recently announced a plan to eliminate [15,000 jobs](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/intels-day-of-reckoning-arrives-15000-jobs-will-be-eliminated) after historically bad quarterly results.

It's been rehearsed to death that Intel missed the boat on [mobile](https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/17/how-intel-missed-the-iphone-revolution/) and [AI](https://fortune.com/2024/08/07/intel-ai-openai-chips-investment/), but IMHO they should have heard an equally serious alarm bell when Apple [ditched Intel for its own processors in 2020](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16226/apple-silicon-m1-a14-deep-dive). Before that transition was announced, one [observer argued that a divorce would be good news for Intel](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/in-this-case-losing-apple-as-a-customer-would-be-good-news-2020-06-15) because Apple was a relatively small percentage of Intel's business and a very demanding customer, and a separation would allow Intel to focus elsewhere. That seems reasonable *a priori*, but unfortunately for Intel, two things happened:

-   The M1 got [glowing](https://www.anandtech.com/print/17024/apple-m1-max-performance-review) [reviews](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/macbook-pro-m1-13-inch-2020)

-   Intel did not, in fact, make the right bets about what to focus on.

Microsoft recently followed in Apple's footsteps and chose the [Qualcomm Snapdragon](Qualcomm Snapdragon) for [its flagship Copilot+ device](https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/ultrabooks-ultraportables/microsoft-surface-pro-2024-review). Meanwhile, Intel's flagship desktop chips are having [serious stability issues](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-announces-an-extra-two-years-of-warranty-for-its-chips-amid-crashing-and-instability-issues-longer-warranty-applies-to-13th-and-14th-gen-core-processors), its next generation of chips is [expected to have unusually high production](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-lunar-lake-is-almost-entirely-outsourced-as-panther-lake-and-clearwater-forest-get-powered-on) costs, and AMD is gaining ground in both the [server](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-records-its-highest-server-market-share-in-decades-but-intel-fights-back-in-client-pcs) and [desktop](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-takes-cpu-market-share-from-intel-in-desktops-and-servers-but-intel-fights-back-in-laptops) markets. All in all, a classic case of the [innovator's dilemma](https://forbes.ge/en/the-innovator-s-dilemma-why-google-is-failing-in-the-ai-game/): Intel didn't want to compete against its own profit centers by investing in alternatives, and now that the market has shifted, Intel has fallen behind.

But the thing is, from what I can see, AMD is not exactly hitting it out of the park. This first came to my attention when I considered buying a mini-PC in early 2024. I wanted something approximately the size and performance of a Playstation 5 but with a bit more flexibility. My thought was that with the PS5 released nearly 4 years ago, and with processors expected to double in performance every 18 months, I could find find something that met the bill.

In January, AMD released two processors, the 8700G and the 8600G, two APUs ("[Accelerated Processing Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_APU)" â€” who comes up with these names?) with CPUs and GPUs on a single die, that are apparently meant to serve the low-power home PC gaming market. But they both got [pretty](https://www.techspot.com/review/2796-amd-ryzen-8700g/) [tepid](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-ryzen-5-8600g-cpu-review) reviews because their price propositions don't really work. If you want to play games cheaply, you can do much better with a few other CPU/GPU combinations, though the machine won't be tiny; and if you want a tiny PC that performs minimally well, you can buy [one of many prebuilt mini PCs](https://minipcs.org/) from manufacturers in China that mostly use AMD's laptop parts which have basically the same specs. (But you won't get anything nearly as good as a 4-year old gaming console, which continues to confuse me.)

In July, AMD released a laptop processor that [outperforms the desktop parts (8700G & 8600G) handily with lower power consumption](https://www.anandtech.com/show/21485/the-amd-ryzen-ai-hx-370-review/9).

So what exactly was AMD thinking here? Why did it release overpriced, under-performing products and then make them obsolete 6 months later? I just can't square this away as part of a reasonable strategy. One explanation is that big companies are like octopuses, and each product division/armn is [essentially its own brain](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-mind-of-an-octopus/) with its own reward structures. I think this model works pretty well for Google, where product shutdowns are [depressingly regular](https://gcemetery.co/google-product-lifespan/) (people set up [websites to count down to cancellation](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21596003)) and generally attributed to [misaligned incentives](https://www.warp.dev/blog/problems-with-promotion-oriented-cultures). But AMD's issues seem more to be about inability to execute successfully.

We see evidence of this in a few different places:

-   Its [naming](https://imgur.com/2ab20Zc) [scheme](https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/yh89xo/what_does_the_letter_x_g_u_h_hs_mean_on_a_ryzen/) for its Ryzen' parts is truly a marvel of impossible to remember details.

-   Its most recent desktop release has a [serious driver issue](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-ryzen-9-9950x-cpu-review/5) that's lasted for \~16 months

-   It continues to [lag badly in the AI/GPU](https://www.techradar.com/computing/gpu/nvidia-now-owns-88-of-the-gpu-market-but-that-might-not-be-a-bad-thing-yet\) market basically in large part [because its software ](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39344815)isn't competitive.

Basically, I see a company that capitalized on its main competitor's struggles and continues to release some very successful, specialized products, but that seems to be its own worst enemy in terms of execution and launch. I think this has gotten less attention than it might in light of Intel's more obviously existential struggle.

I suppose if I were tasked with fixing things at AMD, I would say:

-   Get the product marketing right. Name the products simple, memorable things. Look at Apple.

-   If the price proposition doesn't work, subsidize. Sell the 8600G at a loss and make future processors backwards compatible and encourage upgrades.

-   Make the AI software work. (Lisa Su says, about her experiences with the Playstation 3: "[Perhaps one could say, if you look in hindsight, programmability is so important](https://stratechery.com/2024/an-interview-with-amd-ceo-lisa-su-about-solving-hard-problems/)." Ok but so how about today...)

But who knows? I am just seeing a small part of the puzzle. I will continue to watch with interest.
