<p>Intel recently announced a plan to eliminate <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/intels-day-of-reckoning-arrives-15000-jobs-will-be-eliminated">15,000 jobs</a> after historically bad quarterly results.</p>
<p>It’s been rehearsed to death that Intel missed the boat on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/17/how-intel-missed-the-iphone-revolution/">mobile</a> and <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/08/07/intel-ai-openai-chips-investment/">AI</a>, but IMHO they should have heard an equally serious alarm bell when Apple <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16226/apple-silicon-m1-a14-deep-dive">ditched Intel for its own processors in 2020</a> (which then <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/print/17024/apple-m1-max-performance-review">glowing</a> <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/macbook-pro-m1-13-inch-2020">reviews</a>). In the scheme of things, Apple is a small vendor, but the problem for Intel is that their move seems to have demonstrated companies that ARM-based <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/ultrabooks-ultraportables/microsoft-surface-pro-2024-review">laptops</a> <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/laptops/asus-vivobook-s-15-snapdragon-x-elite-review">are</a> <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2415368/dell-inspiron-14-plus-7441-review-another-copilot-pc.html">viable</a>, and <em>that’s</em> a problem. This should be Intel’s core competency.</p>
<p>Moreover Intel’s desktop chips are having <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-announces-an-extra-two-years-of-warranty-for-its-chips-amid-crashing-and-instability-issues-longer-warranty-applies-to-13th-and-14th-gen-core-processors">serious stability issues</a>; its next generation of chips is <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-lunar-lake-is-almost-entirely-outsourced-as-panther-lake-and-clearwater-forest-get-powered-on">expected to have unusually high production</a> costs; and AMD is gaining ground in both the <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-records-its-highest-server-market-share-in-decades-but-intel-fights-back-in-client-pcs">server</a> and <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-takes-cpu-market-share-from-intel-in-desktops-and-servers-but-intel-fights-back-in-laptops">desktop</a> markets. It’s a bad time to be Intel, but in some ways this is a classic case of an <a href="https://forbes.ge/en/the-innovator-s-dilemma-why-google-is-failing-in-the-ai-game/">old story</a>: Intel didn’t want to compete against its own profit centers by investing in alternatives, and now that the market has shifted, Intel has fallen behind.</p>
<p>But the thing is, from what I can see, AMD is not exactly hitting it out of the park. I started paying attention to this when I looked into buying a mini-PC in early 2024. I wanted something approximately the size and performance of a Playstation 5 but with a bit more flexibility. My thought was that with the PS5 released nearly 4 years ago, and with processors expected to double in performance every 18 months, I could find find something that met the bill.</p>
<p>In January 2024, AMD released two processors, the 8700G and the 8600G, that looked well-suited for this on paper. They’re both APUs (“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_APU">Accelerated Processing Unit</a>” — who comes up with these names?) with CPUs and GPUs on a single die, that are apparently meant to serve the low-power home PC gaming market. But they both got <a href="https://www.techspot.com/review/2796-amd-ryzen-8700g/">pretty</a> <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-ryzen-5-8600g-cpu-review">tepid</a> reviews because their price propositions don’t work.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Then, In July, AMD released a laptop processor that <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/21485/the-amd-ryzen-ai-hx-370-review/9">outperforms</a>those two processors handily with lower power consumption.</p>
<p>So what exactly was AMD thinking when it released the 8700G and 8600G? Why did it release overpriced, underperforming products and then make them obsolete 6 months later?</p>
<p>One explanation is that big companies are like octopuses, and each product division/armn is <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-mind-of-an-octopus/">essentially its own brain</a> with its own reward structures. I think this model works pretty well for Google, where product shutdowns are <a href="https://gcemetery.co/google-product-lifespan/">depressingly regular</a> (people set up <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21596003">websites to count down to cancellation</a>) and generally attributed to <a href="https://www.warp.dev/blog/problems-with-promotion-oriented-cultures">misaligned incentives</a>. But AMD’s issues seem to be less about multiple aims and more about about inability to execute. The strategy of low-power, integrated chips cutting away at Nvidia’s market share at the low end was and is sensible. But the details need to work, and they often don’t.</p>
<p>Some other places where AMD’s displays a somewhat baffling inattention to detail:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Its <a href="https://imgur.com/2ab20Zc">naming</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/yh89xo/what_does_the_letter_x_g_u_h_hs_mean_on_a_ryzen/">scheme</a> for its laptop parts is truly a marvel of impossible to remember details. Why make this hard for buyers? (This is a surprisingly common problem among manufacturers — what does “<a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/monitors/gaming-monitors/xiaomi-g34wqi-34-inch-180-hz-gaming-monitor-review">G34WQi</a>” evoke for you?)</p></li>
<li><p>Its most recent flagship desktop processor is getting <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/flagship-amd-zen-5-ryzen-9-9950x-cpu-reviews-are-a-mixed-bag">mixed to negative reviews</a> because of unexplained performance issues, as well as a <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-ryzen-9-9950x-cpu-review/5">serious driver issue</a> that’s lasted for ~16 months</p></li>
<li><p>The company continues to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/gpu/nvidia-now-owns-88-of-the-gpu-market-but-that-might-not-be-a-bad-thing-yet">lag badly</a> in the AI/GPU market in large part <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39344815">because its software</a> isn’t competitive. (Lisa Su says, about her experiences with the Playstation 3: “<a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/an-interview-with-amd-ceo-lisa-su-about-solving-hard-problems/">Perhaps one could say, if you look in hindsight, programmability is so important</a>.” Ok but so how about today…)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, I see a company that capitalized on its main competitor’s struggles and continues to release some very <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16217/the-xbox-series-x-review-ushering-in-next-gen/2">successful</a>, <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/ps5-pro">specialized</a> products, but that seems to be its own worst enemy in terms of execution and launch. I think this has gotten less attention than it might in light of Intel’s more obviously existential struggle. But inability to execute is also a crisis, albeit one that moves more slowly.</p>
<p>If I were tasked with fixing things at AMD, I would say:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Get the product marketing right. Name the products simple, memorable things. Look at Apple.</p></li>
<li><p>If the price proposition doesn’t work, subsidize. Sell the 8600G at a loss and make future processors backwards compatible and encourage upgrades.</p></li>
<li><p>Make the AI software work.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>But who knows? I am just seeing a small part of the puzzle. I will continue to watch with interest.</p>
