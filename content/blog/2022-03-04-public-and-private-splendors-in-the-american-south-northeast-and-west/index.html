<p>I’ve been nomadic since mid-October 2020 in three distinct phases: as a digital nomad in the mountain West, and then California, for seven months; as a thru-hiker on the AT for six months; and now, for four months, as a resident of New Orleans. What I’ve observed since then is hard to summarize quickly. But let me try to describe something pretty general about different visions of utopia I’ve seen, each splendid in some sense and also, if not quite ‘squalid’, then at least recognizably deprived, hollow.</p>

<h3>Vacation-land</h3>
<p>I first spent a month in Park City, UT, in a big ski house with a view of endless identical rentals from the hot tub on the porch. I split the house with rotating cast of friends, most of whom were fleeing the aftereffects of wildfires in California.</p>
<p>Park City is home to the country’s largest ski resort, as well as the site of the 2002 Winter Olympics. Since then, the city has become a major site of mountain biking and running trails, as well as an altitude training destination for serious runners. I loved running and walking there. The air is clean and crisp, and in October, the mornings were cool and the afternoons hot. Fall was just starting when I got there and winter had come when I left in November. One fine day, walking some trails about 2 miles from our house, I saw a beautiful moose and her babies blocking a path. A 45 minute drive and we were in the [] canyon, one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever hiked.</p>
<p>We were about a mile from the nearest restaurants, and we had continuous walking/biking paths the whole way. The nearest grocery store, a Whole Foods, was more like two miles away, and getting there without a car involved navigating some dangerous intersections. And we were about five miles from downtown Park City; there were free buses on a somewhat unpredictable schedule connecting all these places.</p>
<p>There were sections of town that clearly had permanent residents that I ran through sometimes; the section I liked best had a lovely walking path adjoining a long strip of backyards. The section I was in was full of cookie-cutter vacation homes.</p>
