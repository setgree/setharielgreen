I get a thrill from seeing great actors and actresses show up for a single scene in strange movies. Who convinced Allison Janney to play a forgettable role in _Ma_ ([$5 million budget](https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Ma-(2019)#tab=summary)) or Frances McDermott to show up for one scene in [_Aeon Flux_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86on_Flux_(film))? I suppose I just have no idea what their annual incomes look like and how they think about the costs and benefits of doing a few days of work; or perhaps they did the roles as a favor?
