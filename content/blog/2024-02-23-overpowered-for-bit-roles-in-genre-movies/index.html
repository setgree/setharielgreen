<p>I get a thrill from seeing great actors and actresses show up for a single scene in strange movies. Who convinced Allison Janney to play a forgettable role in <em>Ma</em> (<a href="https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Ma-(2019)#tab=summary">$5 million budget</a>) or Frances McDermott to show up for one scene in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86on_Flux_(film)"><em>Aeon Flux</em></a>? I suppose I just have no idea what their annual incomes look like and how they think about the costs and benefits of doing a few days of work; or perhaps they did the roles as a favor?</p>
