I am co-author on a [new meta-analysis](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/q6xyr) about interventions aimed at reducing consumption of meat and animal products. We conclude that no theoretical approach, delivery mechanism, or persuasive message should be considered a well-validated means of reducing MAP consumption.
