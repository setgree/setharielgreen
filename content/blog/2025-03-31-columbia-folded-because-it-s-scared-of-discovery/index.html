<p>At my local cafe last week, some incensed folks asked: why didn’t Columbia have more courage? Why couldn’t the Ivy League band together and mount a hearty legal defense?</p>
<p>I think <a href="https://x.com/patio11">@patio11</a> has the <a href="https://x.com/patio11/status/1678235882481127427">right answer here</a>:</p>

<p>I’d take essentially any odds on a wager that at some point in the past 10-15 years, some high-level administrators wrote, in their work emails, things that have been deemed unconstitutional in light of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students_for_Fair_Admissions_v._Harvard"><em>Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard</em></a>. I doubt Columbia is scared of SFA, but I bet they’re scared of the DOJ. I’d bet there are at least a few high-ranking folks there who would love to initiate FBI raids in a “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/melania-trump-violated-new-underwear-mar-a-lago-raid-report-2022-9">how do you like it</a>?” spirit. I don’t think the Columbia administration <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/statutes-enforced-criminal-section#:~:text=committed%20by%20others.-,A%20violation%20of%20the%20statute%20is%20a%20misdemeanor,-%2C%20unless%20prosecutors%20prove">would be looking at jail time</a>, but honestly, who knows?</p>
<p>If you had those kinds of skeletons, you’d probably fold too.</p>
