<p>At my local cafe last week, folks seemed incensed by this. Why didn’t Columbia have more courage, they asked? Why couldn’t the Ivy League band together and mount a hearty legal defense?</p>
<p>I think <a href="https://x.com/patio11">@patio11</a> has the right answer here:</p>

<p>I’d take essentially any odds on a wager that at some point in the 10-15 years, some high-level administrators wrote, in their work emails, things that rhyme with: “let’s hire this person because they’re [not] [X protected group]”. I don’t think Columbia is scared of <a href="https://studentsforfairadmissions.org/">Students for Fair Admissions</a>. I do think they’re scared of the DOJ. I’d bet that there are at least a few folks there who are itching to initiate FBI raids in a “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/melania-trump-violated-new-underwear-mar-a-lago-raid-report-2022-9">how do you like it</a>?” spirit. I don’t think <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/statutes-enforced-criminal-section#:~:text=committed%20by%20others.-,A%20violation%20of%20the%20statute%20is%20a%20misdemeanor,-%2C%20unless%20prosecutors%20prove">they’d be looking at jail time</a>, but honestly, who knows?</p>
<p>[Prompted by two conversations in the last with folks who know a bit about the situation.]</p>
