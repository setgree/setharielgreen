At my local cafe last week, folks seemed incensed by this. Why didn't Columbia have more courage, they asked? Why couldn't the Ivy League band together and mount a hearty legal defense?

I think [\@patio11](https://x.com/patio11) has the [right answer here](https://x.com/patio11/status/1678235882481127427):

I'd take essentially any odds on a wager that at some point in the past 10-15 years, some high-level administrators wrote, in their work emails, things that rhyme with: "let's hire this person because they are/are not [member of a protected category]". I don't think Columbia is scared of [Students for Fair Admissions](https://studentsforfairadmissions.org/). I do think they're scared of the DOJ. I'd bet that there are at least a few folks there who are itching to initiate FBI raids in a "[how do you like it](https://www.businessinsider.com/melania-trump-violated-new-underwear-mar-a-lago-raid-report-2022-9)?" spirit. I don't think [they'd be looking at jail time](https://www.justice.gov/crt/statutes-enforced-criminal-section#:~:text=committed%20by%20others.-,A%20violation%20of%20the%20statute%20is%20a%20misdemeanor,-%2C%20unless%20prosecutors%20prove), but honestly, who knows?

[Prompted by two conversations in the last week with folks who know a bit about the situation.]
