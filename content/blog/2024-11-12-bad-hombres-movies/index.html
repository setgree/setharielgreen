<p>It’s a conservative trope that Hollywood <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/west-hollywood-resolution-to-remove-trump-from-walk-of-fame/">hates</a> <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/steven-spielbergs-anti-trump-movie-post-meryl-streep-and-tom-hanks/">Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/03/oscars-liberal-bias-full-display-this-year/">conservatives</a> and all they <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/mar/9/hollywoods-radical-left-reality/">hold dear</a>. But we still get movies with fundamentally Trump-y themes animating them. Consider what we might call the “bad hombres” genre:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Night_(2023_film)#Critical_response"><em>Silent Night</em></a>, in which a (white) man seeks vengeance against (Latino) gangsters in southern California after they kill his son</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peppermint_(2018_film)"><em>Peppermint</em></a>, which has basically the same plot except it stars Jennifer Garner</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brawl_in_Cell_Block_99">Brawl in Cell Block 99</a>, in which some bad (Latino) gangsters try to ruin Vince Vaughn’s life because he’s prudent and ethically grounded (apparently its studio <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/how-cinestate-film-studio-is-turning-controversial-topics-revenue-1178338/">has a populist bent</a>)</li>
<li>…probably others I haven’t seen (ChatGPT suggests <em>The Marksman, Rambo: Last Blood</em>, and <em>Sicario).</em></li>
</ul>
<p>There’s something unseemly about both sneering at these concerns and then seeking to profit from them.</p>
<p>Personally I prefer movies like <em>The Forever Purge</em> and <em>The Hunt</em>, which approach the same material with a more sociological eye. (The <em>Purge</em> movies in particular, I think, will be remembered as powerfully zeitgeist-y while the bad hombres movies are more likely to be forgotten or looked at with revulsion.)</p>
