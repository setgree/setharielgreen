It's a conservative trope that Hollywood [hates](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/west-hollywood-resolution-to-remove-trump-from-walk-of-fame/) [Trump](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/steven-spielbergs-anti-trump-movie-post-meryl-streep-and-tom-hanks/), [conservatives](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/03/oscars-liberal-bias-full-display-this-year/) and all they [hold dear](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/mar/9/hollywoods-radical-left-reality/). But we still get movies with fundamentally Trump-y themes animating them. Consider what we might call the "bad hombres" genre:

-   [*Silent Night*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Night_(2023_film)#Critical_response), in which a (white) man seeks vengeance against (Latino) gangsters in southern California after they kill his son
-   [*Peppermint*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peppermint_(2018_film)), which has basically the same plot except it stars Jennifer Garner
-   [Brawl in Cell Block 99](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brawl_in_Cell_Block_99), in which some bad (Latino) gangsters try to ruin Vince Vaughn's life because he's prudent and ethically grounded (apparently its studio [has a populist bent](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/how-cinestate-film-studio-is-turning-controversial-topics-revenue-1178338/))
-   ...probably others I haven't seen (ChatGPT suggests *The Marksman, Rambo: Last Blood*, and *Sicario).*

There's something unseemly about both sneering at these concerns and then seeking to profit from them.

Personally I prefer movies like *The Forever Purge* and *The Hunt*, which approach the same material with a more sociological eye. (The *Purge* movies in particular, I think, will be remembered as powerfully zeitgeist-y while the bad hombres movies are more likely to be forgotten or looked at with revulsion.)
