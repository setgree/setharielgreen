<p>I am reading <em>Lord of the Rings</em> (<a href="https://setharielgreen.com/blog/the-pleasure-of-the-appendices-of-the-lord-of-the-rings/">again</a>) and as always, there are many <a href="https://setharielgreen.com/blog/all-the-words-in-lord-of-the-rings-that-i-did-not-know/">words</a>), phrases and names I don’t know. But this time I am reading on my Kindle, so when Denethor talks about “Vorondil father of Mardil” who “hunted the wild kine of Araw in the far fields of Rhûnm,” I can at least look up ‘Vorondil’ and cross-check his place in the appendix.</p>
<p>Even better would be an easy way to pull up and cross-check the <a href="https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Main_Page">Tolkien Gateway</a>, or the <a href="http://lotrproject.com/map/#zoom=3&amp;lat=-1315.5&amp;lon=1500&amp;layers=BTTTTT">Interactive Middle-Earth map</a>, or perhaps Andy Serkis’s off-kilter renditions of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lordoftherings/comments/pwgqjc/for_those_of_you_who_have_heard_them_does_andy/">Tom Bombadil’s songs</a> in a way that allowed the reader to luxuriate in the details without losing their place in the text.</p>
<p>I suppose that copyright is one of the big reasons we don’t have such projects. But if the creators of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin_(emulator)">Dolphin emulator</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmy%27s_Despecialized_Edition#Legality">Harmy’s Despecialized Edition</a> can persist and even thrive in legal limbo, why not a book?</p>
<p>I suspect that there are some unsolved <a href="https://setharielgreen.com/blog/ux-testing-for-public-infrastructure/">UX problems</a> here, and I think this could be a good project for someone who believes in the <a href="https://www.transformativeworks.org/">transformative power</a> of derivative works.</p>
