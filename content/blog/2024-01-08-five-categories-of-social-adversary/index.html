<p>When trying to explain a social problem, we might argue any of the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Those people are bad</strong>, e.g. blame the capitalists for <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/04/blaming-capitalism-is-not-an-alternative-to-solving-problems.html">global warming</a>, the poor <a href="https://www.econlib.org/archives/2012/02/how_deserving_a.html">for their predicament</a>, or the Jews for “a whole range of things…from <a href="https://www.thehenryford.org/collections-and-research/digital-resources/popular-topics/henry-ford-and-anti-semitism-a-complex-story">the world war to short skirts to jazz music</a>.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>That policy is harmful</strong>, e.g. a minimum wage might “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/14/opinion/the-right-minimum-wage-0.00.html">price working poor people out of the job market</a>.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Those people are too radical</strong>, e.g. too quick to adopt <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/guys-it-turns-out-everyone-loves-dei-now/">relatively</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/14/health/puberty-blockers-transgender.html">untested</a> ideas as enduring truths.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Those people are too conservative</strong>, e.g. too resistant to <a href="https://www.avclub.com/katt-williams-thoughtfully-disassembles-cancel-culture-1847040238">positive</a> <a href="https://www.avclub.com/ricky-gervais-the-office-david-brent-armageddon-1851129277">changes</a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Lately I find myself reaching for a fifth explanation that blends (3) and (4):</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>those people are stuck in the local maximum of a failed social experiment,</strong> e.g. <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/singapore-urbanism">stroads</a>, <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/houses-not-zoning">single-family zoning</a>, and <a href="https://thehumaneleague.org/article/what-is-factory-farming">concentrated animal feeding operations</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This argument <em>feels</em> liberal because it militates towards social upheaval, but in each case, the social problem is approximately as old as my parents (or <a href="https://www.berkeleyside.org/2021/02/24/berkeley-denounces-racist-history-of-single-family-zoning-begins-2-year-process-to-change-general-plan">grandparents</a>) and emerged because we’ve forgotten older wisdom about how to <a href="https://www.timeout.com/europe/most-walkable-cities-in-europe-to-explore-on-foot">get around</a>, <a href="https://www.ece.com/en/blog/urban-development-the-future-belongs-to-mixed-use">live and work together</a>, and <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2022/08/the-moral-atrocity-of-factory-farming-and-why-we-must-not-look-away">treat animals</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/27/books/the-most-compassionate-conservative.html">under our care</a>. But social states <a href="https://www.csun.edu/~snk1966/Talcott%20Parsons%20-%20An%20Outline%20of%20the%20Social%20System.pdf">create their own momentum</a> and can easily persist even if <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674707580">most people wish for change</a>. In other words, ‘<a href="https://equilibriabook.com/">inadequate equilibria</a>’ endure.</p>
<p>This explanation blends aspects of both <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/24/conflict-vs-mistake">Conflict and Mistake theory</a>. There’s a conflict insofar as many people seem committed to something that I (and others) think can be improved on; there’s a mistake insofar as I (and others) think that once we get there, most people will come around.</p>
<p>The most troubling critique of this theory is that it offers <a href="https://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/08/21/the-illusion-of-asymmetric-insight/">asymmetric insight</a> into the myopia of others.</p>
