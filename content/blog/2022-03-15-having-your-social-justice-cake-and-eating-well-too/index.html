<p>A few years ago, a friend was doing a prestigious postdoc at a prominent law school. One time, a scholar who was in town for a seminar asked to be taken to a thousand-dollar-a-head restaurant,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and it was my friend’s responsibility to clear that with their department chair – who promptly said, more or less, “no problem.” So out they went, my friend, the visiting scholar, and a few others; and thus did the school spend something like 10% of a law student’s yearly tuition on a single dinner.</p>
<p>My friend’s research has a clear pro-social, human-focused agenda, and they are a member of an intersectionally underrepresented group among law school faculty, so in two important respects, they and their career advance social justice. They are also, as a law school professor, earning something in the ballpark of a first year <a href="https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-raise-tracker-2022/">biglaw associate’s salary</a>,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and, as the above story illustrates, the job comes with some perks that you might typically associate with people one or two levels <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/climbing-the-wealth-ladder/">up the economic ladder</a>.</p>
<p>Is this not quite the feat? For reasons of taste and history, the job actively selects for a social justice research agenda, while simultaneously allowing you to sidestep the lifestyle trade-offs that we associate with social justice careers – a <a href="https://www.salary.com/research/salary/benchmark/social-worker-msw-salary/new-orleans-la">social worker’s salary</a>, a public defender’s <a href="https://thelensnola.org/2021/01/20/the-system-is-at-a-breaking-point-new-da-public-defenders-work-to-reduce-backlog-of-cases-at-criminal-district-court/">overstuffed docket</a>,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> the <a href="https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/management/workforce/workforcewellbeing/burnout/">heartbreak and burnout</a> of working directly with at-risk youth. In other words, the job confers both the status benefits of a social justice career and the lifestyle benefits of <a href="https://www.thebellows.org/the-double-horseshoe-theory/">joining the PMC</a>.</p>
<p>A related phenomenon: a lot of LinkedIn posts tell what I think of as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juicy_(The_Notorious_B.I.G._song)">‘Juicy’</a> narrative – “It was all a dream/I used to read Word Up! magazine,” etc. Juicy posts start out with a story of hardship, like an impoverished childhood, and end with a clear-cut status success, like an acceptance into Harvard or a job at Meta.</p>
<p>In a different era, we would have called these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Alger">‘Horatio Alger’ stories</a>. Their message is that because the authors started out with little, their successes can be attributed to talent and grit. Such stories also, I think, affirm that we live in a meritocracy where hard-working folks from under-represented groups can succeed, even if they faced discrimination and prejudice along the way, which damn the system as a whole. It’s a fine balance to strike, but Juicy posts celebrate and affirm the American myth while simultaneously decrying systemic injustices.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>If <a href="https://infinitejest.wallacewiki.com/david-foster-wallace/index.php?title=M">yrstruly</a> announced such an accomplishment with the same fanfare, it would be, I think, pretty gauche. There is nothing even remotely social justice-y about my <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2001/apr/15/workandcareers.madeleinebunting3">climbing the greasy pole</a>; in fact, because status is <a href="http://daviddfriedman.blogspot.com/2006/10/economics-of-status.html">fundamentally zero sum</a>, my doing so is (implicitly) denying opportunities to people with fewer privileges.</p>
<p>And thus are certain folks empowered to have their social justice cake and eat well too. Just being yourself suffices for advancing equity and representation, and whether it’s ethical to <a href="https://techpolicy.press/is-it-ethical-to-work-at-facebook/">take a job at Meta in the first place</a> is back of mind.</p>
<p>I would not call this the main way in which the overarching system of our lives is reified, turning would-be firebrands into people whose crusades are more within the lines. But it is one way in which we are guided towards swimming with the currents.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>If you are a big-shot academic in one of the well-off disciplines, the norm is that other schools will cover your flight, hotels, and meals if you come and give a lecture. Typically, this involves one very nice dinner.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn4"><p>‘Juicy’ the song also effectively strikes this balance.
