I recently presented an in-progress paper at the [Humane and Sustainable Food Lab](https://www.foodlabstanford.com/), where I will be taking a research scientist job starting on July 1st.

The recording is on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW2dZmUCVQU) and the slides are [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/kuk72ekmzopdnstadqwwn/nudges_norms_persuasion_presentation.pdf?rlkey=rcmq6ng6vphkbvc9z7awveo0j&dl=0).
