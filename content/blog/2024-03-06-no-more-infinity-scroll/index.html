<p>Like <a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/how-to-break-free-from-dopamine-culture">many people</a>, I am troubled by my relationship with screens, particularly my phone’s. I am trying three remedies. First, I use my phone in <a href="https://www.wmagazine.com/culture/lorde-internet-addiction-cure">grayscale, like Lorde</a>. Second, I avoid screens from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_Shabbat">Friday sundown to Saturday sundown</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Third, I deactivated my Facebook, and Instagram accounts, logged out of LinkedIn and Twitter, and deleted Reddit from my phone. For LinkedIn and Twitter, I deleted my passwords so I’d have to go through a recovery process to log in again.</p>
<p>Nothing radical here: we all recognize that <a href="https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/how-the-invention-of-infinite-scrolling-turned-millions-to-addiction-3096602ef9af?gi=7bd25b366481">infinity scroll is bad for our brains</a>. But today I’m noticing how social media companies have made it easier, once you’ve decided to log off, to <em>stay</em> off by making it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mobileweb/comments/f40xhi/this_has_to_be_a_joke_right_now_you_cant_access/">harder to browse</a> <a href="https://mashable.com/article/instagram-requires-log-in-to-view-profiles">when not</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/pa6dra/twitter_starts_to_require_login_to_view_tweets/">logged in</a>. Scrolling becomes an ordeal, and an ordeal is a fine <a href="https://www.thebehavioralscientist.com/glossary/commitment-device">commitment device</a>. I actively want to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2021/aug/22/how-digital-media-turned-us-all-into-dopamine-addicts-and-what-we-can-do-to-break-the-cycle">kept out of the kingdom</a>, like a compulsive gambler <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4016676/">self-excluding from a casino</a>, and for whatever reason, the <a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/the-state-of-the-culture-2024">dopamine cartel</a> helps by lowering the portcullis behind me.</p>
<p>I doubt a social planner would have designed things this way, but as a solution, it has the nice properties of being organic and voluntary.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>This has sometimes made making plans difficult, and I’ve been cheating to text and stuff; unfortunately once I pick up my phone, in my mind, all bets are off. What I really need is a dumb phone I can put my SIM card into on such occasions.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
