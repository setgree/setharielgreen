<p>Like <a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/how-to-break-free-from-dopamine-culture">many people</a>, I am unhappy with my relationship with screens, particularly my phone. I am trying two remedies. First, I am doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_Shabbat">digital Shabbat</a> where I don’t look at any screens from Friday sundown to Saturday sundown.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Second, I deactivated my Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts, logged out of LinkedIn, and deleted the Reddit app from my phone. For LinkedIn and Twitter, I deleted my passwords as well so I’d have to go through a recovery process to log in again.</p>
<p>Nothing radical here: we all recognize that <a href="https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/how-the-invention-of-infinite-scrolling-turned-millions-to-addiction-3096602ef9af?gi=7bd25b366481">infinity scroll is bad for our brains</a>. But today I’m noticing an unintended consequence of the way social media companies have made it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mobileweb/comments/f40xhi/this_has_to_be_a_joke_right_now_you_cant_access/">harder to browse</a> <a href="https://mashable.com/article/instagram-requires-log-in-to-view-profiles">when not</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/pa6dra/twitter_starts_to_require_login_to_view_tweets/">logged in</a>: it’s easy to stay off once you’re off. By making it an ordeal to scroll without an account, they’ve set us up with a fine <a href="https://www.thebehavioralscientist.com/glossary/commitment-device">commitment device</a>.</p>
<p>These companies face a trade-off between maximizing data collection and making an enticing experience to unregistered users, and they’ve all resolved it in favor of data collection. That’s gross, but for my part, I’m glad, because I want to be kept out of the kingdom, like a compulsive gambler <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4016676/">self-excluding from a casino</a>.</p>
<p>I doubt a social planner would have designed things this way, but as a solution, it has the nice properties of being organic and voluntary.</p>

What I really need is a dumb phone I can put my SIM card into on such occasions.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
