<p>I notice that a lot of writers I like have moved their blogs to substack.</p>
<p>I presume they’re getting a lot of money for this – Danny Lavery was kind enough to tell the <em>NYT</em> that his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/11/business/media/substack-newsletter-competition.html">2-year contract was worth $430,000</a>. Danny currently has “<a href="https://www.thechatner.com/">over 16,000 subscribers</a>” so I can see why he found this deal attractive.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>But as a reader, Substack sucks. When I click a blogpost, it’s because I want to read it, not</p>
<ul>
<li>share my email</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/1-first%20screen%20is%20a%20paywall.png" height = "60%" width = "60%"></p>
<ul>
<li>pay a bunch of money for a product I don’t understand</li>
</ul>
<p><img src= "images/2-defaults%20to%20wanting%20my%20money.png" height = "60%" width = "60%"></p>
<ul>
<li>post about it on my “profile”</li>
</ul>
<p><img src= "images/3-dumb-social-stuff.png" height = "60%" width = "60%"></p>
<ul>
<li>recommend it to strangers</li>
</ul>
<p><img src= "images/4-asks%20for%20my%20social%20media%20stuff.png" height = "60%" width = "60%"></p>
<ul>
<li>or share it on Twitter.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/5-twitter.png" height = "60%" width = "60%"></p>
<p>All of these things help Substack make money and add friction to my reading experience. We get used to these things gradually – that’s how the <a href="https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1331633102762831873">shitty technology adoption curve works</a>. But the UX sucks.</p>
<p>I hope we return to more open technology and a more open blogging culture.</p>
