<p>A lot of writers I like have moved to Substack.</p>
<p>I presume that some of them are doing it for a big payday, e.g. Danny Lavery was kind enough to tell the <em>Times</em> that his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/11/business/media/substack-newsletter-competition.html">2-year Substack contract was worth $430,000</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Others say that it <a href="https://betonit.substack.com/p/my-substack-transition">multiplied their readership</a>.</p>
<p>But as a reader, Substack is a big step down from (e.g.) blogspot, wordpress, or self-hosted content. When I click a blogpost, it’s because I want to read it, not</p>
<ul>
<li>share my email</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/1-first%20screen%20is%20a%20paywall.png" height = "60%" width = "60%"></p>
<ul>
<li>shell out cash for a product (the newsletter) I don’t know yet</li>
</ul>
<p><img src= "images/2-defaults%20to%20wanting%20my%20money.png" height = "60%" width = "60%"></p>
<ul>
<li>post about it on my “profile”</li>
</ul>
<p><img src= "images/3-dumb-social-stuff.png" height = "60%" width = "60%"></p>
<ul>
<li>recommend it to strangers</li>
</ul>
<p><img src= "images/4-asks%20for%20my%20social%20media%20stuff.png" height = "60%" width = "60%"></p>
<ul>
<li>or share it on Twitter.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/5-twitter.png" height = "60%" width = "60%"></p>
<p>All of these things help Substack make money and add friction to the reading experience. We get used to these things gradually – that’s how the <a href="https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1331633102762831873">shitty technology adoption curve works</a>. But it comes at the expense of a reader experience that prioritizes <em>reading</em>, rather than clicks or eyeballs.</p>
<p>I hope we return to more open technology and a more open blogging culture.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Danny currently has “<a href="https://www.thechatner.com/">over 16,000 subscribers</a>” so I can see why he found this deal attractive.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>BTW I’m aware of the irony that the images on this post would probably look better if I had used Substack to compose it. The alternative, I think, is I could learn a lot of HTML and make images that auto-size depending on your zoom. But I think it’s ok for them to look a little janky. They’re meant to be illustrative rather than enticing.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
