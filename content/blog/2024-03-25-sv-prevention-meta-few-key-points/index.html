<p>I am a co-author on a new meta-analysis: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/15291006231221978">Preventing Sexual Violence —A Behavioral Problem Without a Behaviorally-Informed Solution</a>, along with <a href="https://en.politics.huji.ac.il/people/roni-porat">Roni Porat</a>, <a href="https://www.anagantman.com/">Ana P. Gantman</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/john_pezzuto?lang=en">John-Henry Pezzuto</a>, and <a href="http://www.betsylevypaluck.com/">Elizabeth Levy Paluck</a>.</p>
<p>The vast majority of papers try to change ideas about sexual violence and are moderately successful at that. However, on the most crucial outcomes — perpetration and victimization — the primary prevention literature has not yet found its footing. We argue that the field should take a more behavioralist approach and focus on the environmental and structural determinants of violence.</p>
