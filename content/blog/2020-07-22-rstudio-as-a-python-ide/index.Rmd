So far, I've found it pretty viable. I am a Python n00b but used it a bit to create [my last post](https://setharielgreen.com/2020/07/21/all-the-words-in-lord-of-the-rings-that-i-did-not-know/) ([source `.Rmd` here](https://github.com/setgree/setharielgreen/blob/master/content/post/2020-07-14-all-the-words-in-lord-of-the-rings-that-i-did-not-know.Rmd)). 

The main advantage is that it brings all the key bindings I'm used to. YMMV, but I also really like how easy Rstudio makes it to execute code as I'm iterating, whether in a script or the interpreter. As far as I know, there's no "Python-first" IDE that does this as well as Rstudio does this for R.

Rstudio also has really nice auto-complete and pop-up documentation:

I like this a lot. Maybe another IDE could have provided it if I kept looking. But Rstudio is what I know, so I was pleased to learn that these features carried over.

### Setup:
I use Conda environments and Conda's python and spent most of my setup trying to get Rstudio to recognize that.

* install and load `reticulate`;

* create a Conda environment called `r-reticulate` (I did this from the command line but `reticulate::conda_create()` would work, I think); 
* Add to your `.Rprofile` the equivalent of `Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_MINICONDA_PATH = '~/miniconda3/')` (that's where my miniconda installation was, and `reticulate` had some trouble finding it); 
* `use_miniconda(condaenv = 'r-reticulate', require = T)` will tell R which Python to use and where to find the relevant environment. 

From there, Rstudio has a built-in "new Python script" option in the menu, or you can write an Rmarkdown script and specify that a given  chunk should be Python.

### Issues
* Reticulate's documentation on the Conda front is a work-in-progress, I got a bunch of errors about Python not being found and solving them was a bit unintuitive. But I think if you follow the above steps, it'll work.
* For my own curiosity, I created an `.Rmd` with R, bash, and Python chunks in order, and found that the R and Python chunks worked out of the box but the bash chunk did not. Turns out that [bash chunks in Rmarkdown only work (interactively) when chunk output is inline rather than to console ](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/7398).^[This is kind of a niche use case (maybe not?) but it seems that Jupyter, as a design choice, [does not natively support multi-language notebooks](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/2815#issuecomment-321538857), though I see that it's come up again recently for [Microsoft notebooks](https://github.com/microsoft/azuredatastudio/issues/9580).] 

But once I paid those setup costs, it's been pretty good.
