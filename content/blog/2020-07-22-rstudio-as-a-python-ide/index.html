<p>So far, I’ve found it pretty viable. I am a Python n00b but used it a bit to create <a href="https://setharielgreen.com/2020/07/21/all-the-words-in-lord-of-the-rings-that-i-did-not-know/">my last post</a> (<a href="https://github.com/setgree/setharielgreen/blob/master/content/post/2020-07-14-all-the-words-in-lord-of-the-rings-that-i-did-not-know.Rmd">source <code>.Rmd</code> here</a>).</p>
<p>The main advantage is that it brings all the key bindings I’m used to. YMMV, but I also really like how easy Rstudio makes it to execute code as I’m iterating, whether in a script or the interpreter. As far as I know, there’s no “Python-first” IDE that does this as well as Rstudio does this for R.</p>
<p>Rstudio also has really nice auto-complete and pop-up documentation:</p>

<p>I like this a lot. Maybe another IDE could have provided it if I kept looking. But Rstudio is what I know, so I was pleased to learn that these features carried over.</p>
<div id="setup" class="section level3">
<h3>Setup:</h3>
<p>I use Conda environments and Conda’s python and spent most of my setup trying to get Rstudio to recognize that.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>install and load <code>reticulate</code>;</p></li>
<li><p>create a Conda environment called <code>r-reticulate</code> (I did this from the command line but <code>reticulate::conda_create()</code> would work, I think);</p></li>
<li><p>Add to your <code>.Rprofile</code> the equivalent of <code>Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_MINICONDA_PATH = '~/miniconda3/')</code> (that’s where my miniconda installation was, and <code>reticulate</code> had some trouble finding it);</p></li>
<li><p><code>use_miniconda(condaenv = 'r-reticulate', require = T)</code> will tell R which Python to use and where to find the relevant environment.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>From there, Rstudio has a built-in “new Python script” option in the menu, or you can write an Rmarkdown script and specify that a given chunk should be Python.</p>

<h3>Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reticulate’s documentation on the Conda front is a work-in-progress, I got a bunch of errors about Python not being found and solving them was a bit unintuitive. But I think if you follow the above steps, it’ll work.</li>
<li>For my own curiosity, I created an <code>.Rmd</code> with R, bash, and Python chunks in order, and found that the R and Python chunks worked out of the box but the bash chunk did not. Turns out that <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/7398">bash chunks in Rmarkdown only work (interactively) when chunk output is inline rather than to console</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>But once I paid those setup costs, it’s been pretty good.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>This is kind of a niche use case (maybe not?) but it seems that Jupyter, as a design choice, <a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/2815#issuecomment-321538857">does not natively support multi-language notebooks</a>, though I see that it’s come up again recently for <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/azuredatastudio/issues/9580">Microsoft notebooks</a>.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
