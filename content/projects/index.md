### Documentation
* I wrote ~50% of https://help.codeocean.com/en/ -- the  ['Reproducibility and Preservation'](https://help.codeocean.com/en/collections/500077-reproducibility-and-preservation) and ['Tutorials'](https://help.codeocean.com/en/collections/1910642-tutorials) sections reflect my voice pretty well, I think. (Another teammate's name subsequently got appended to everything.)
