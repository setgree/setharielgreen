### Documentation
* I wrote ~50% of https://help.codeocean.com/en/ -- I think the  ['Reproducibility and Preservation'](https://help.codeocean.com/en/collections/500077-reproducibility-and-preservation) and ['Tutorials'](https://help.codeocean.com/en/collections/1910642-tutorials) sections reflect my voice pretty well, I think. (Another teammate's name subsequently got appended to everything.)

### Culture, Politics, &c. 

* A few things on _Grand Blog Tarkin_: [The Walking Dead and the Politics of Apocalypse Fiction](https://blogtarkin.wordpress.com/2014/12/01/the-walking-dead-and-the-politics-of-apocalypse-fiction/) and [Ender’s Shadow and Offense-Defense Theory](https://blogtarkin.wordpress.com/2013/11/01/enders-shadow-and-offense-defense-theory/) that reflect some stuff I was thinking about while in grad school.
