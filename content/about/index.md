Hi I'm Seth! I am a freelance writer currently based in New Orleans. Previously I was a Data Analyst at [Riskified](https://www.riskified.com/), Developer Advocate at [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/), grad student in political science at Columbia. I've worked with members of Betsy Levy Paluck's lab, in various capacities, on a few papers [1](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioural-public-policy/article/contact-hypothesis-reevaluated/142C913E7FA9E121277B29E994124EC5) [2](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-psych-071620-030619) [3](https://osf.io/w9hqs/).

I'm about 80% done with a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail.

Some music I like: 
* Lambchop's ['The Hustle'](https://genius.com/Lambchop-the-hustle-lyrics), and, more recently,
* A lot of things in the 'Viking folk' category like [Eldrim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfyPSUgkUbY) and [Wardruna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEizKmZlUAw).
